I would spend maybe 10 minutes reading the same instructions over and over, then spend 30 minutes on amazon, or otherwise somewhere else on the computer. Then I'd go back to the problem and read the same instructions over again and continue the cycle over for hours and hours. I was soooo worked up. So today, I didn't really have any room in my head for debugging or anything else. I watched along, and tried to follow, but it wasn't my whole brain watching. I watched a ton of youtube videos, which everyone said was a little excessive, but I think it was good for me. To an extent. I was exhausted. Too exhausted.Today ended with chatting with Sage. She convinced me that I needed to walk away formmy computer, so that's what I'll do.",
